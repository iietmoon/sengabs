Beautiful & Fast add-ons for Elementor. Enhance your site building experience with Stax Elementor Addons

== Description ==
Stax Elementor Addons is a very fast and lightweight plugin that adds new widgets and enhancements to Elementor.

We use a super modular approach so any CSS or Javascript for a module is added to the page only if you use that widget.
Also you can enable just the modules you want to see and use in the Elementor interface.

Current Elementor add-on widgets:
- **Slider Widget** - Easily create a content Slider with Title, Subtitle, Description, Image and Button

- **Dropdown Button Widget** - Allows you to have a button with dropdown functionality. Dropdown entries are added and configured from the widget
- **Heading Widget** - Allows you to have a highlight word or phrase in your heading. Define different text color/ background. Also you can add a subtitle, description and separator
- **Button Widget** - Adds Box Shadow on hover option
